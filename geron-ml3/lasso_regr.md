# Lasso Regression:  

LASSO regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a popular technique used in statistical modeling and machine learning to estimate the relationships between variables and make predictions. LASSO stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator.  

The primary goal of LASSO regression is to find a balance between model simplicity and accuracy. It achieves this by adding a penalty term to the traditional linear regression model, which encourages sparse solutions where some coefficients are forced to be exactly zero. This feature makes LASSO particularly useful for feature selection, as it can automatically identify and discard irrelevant or redundant variables.
