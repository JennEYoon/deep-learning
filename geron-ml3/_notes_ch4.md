  # Ch 4 notes 

Gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent full sample, mini batch.  
### 8/13/2023 Sunday:  
This week finish chp4 and study code.  
Refer to NNFS book for details, if needed.  

Where does 2 come from? 2/m  in SGD equation.  
SVD artifact?  
Not in Normal Equation   
Need to try running equation with Real numbers.   

Math review might have something on it.  

Ridge generally preferred over LASSO. Too harsh, push too many feature weights to zero.   
ElasticNet more flexible than LASSO, jse instead.  

### 8/30  
finished watching Youtube SDML meetup.  Pretty good.  
Go over math slowly. Use actual numbers to test it with code.  
Can go ahead of my small group by reading ahead and watching SDML group recordings.
