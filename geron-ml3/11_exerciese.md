Glorot initialization and He initialization were designed to make the output standard deviation as close as possible to the input standard deviation, at least at the beginning of training. This reduces the vanishing/exploding gradients problem.  
No, all weights should be sampled independently; they should not all have the same initial value. One important goal of sampling weights randomly is to break symmetry: if all the weights have the same initial value, even if that value is not zero, then symmetry is not broken (i.e., all neurons in a given layer are equivalent), and backpropagation will be unable to break it. Concretely, this means that all the neurons in any given layer will always have the same weights. It's like having just one neuron per layer, and much slower. It is virtually impossible for such a configuration to converge to a good solution.  
It is perfectly fine to initialize the bias terms to zero. Some people like to initialize them just like weights, and that's OK too; it does not make much difference.  
ReLU is usually a good default for the hidden layers, as it is fast and yields good results. Its ability to output precisely zero can also be useful in some cases (e.g., see Chapter 17). Moreover, it can sometimes benefit from optimized implementations as well as from hardware acceleration. The leaky ReLU variants of ReLU can improve the model's quality without hindering its speed too much compared to ReLU. For large neural nets and more complex problems, GLU, Swish and Mish can give you a slightly higher quality model, but they have a computational cost. The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) can be useful in the output layer if you need to output a number in a fixed range (by default between –1 and 1), but nowadays it is not used much in hidden layers, except in recurrent nets. The sigmoid activation function is also useful in the output layer when you need to estimate a probability (e.g., for binary classification), but it is rarely used in hidden layers (there are exceptions—for example, for the coding layer of variational autoencoders; see Chapter 17). The softplus activation function is useful in the output layer when you need to ensure that the output will always be positive. The softmax activation function is useful in the output layer to estimate probabilities for mutually exclusive classes, but it is rarely (if ever) used in hidden layers.  
If you set the momentum hyperparameter too close to 1 (e.g., 0.99999) when using an SGD optimizer, then the algorithm will likely pick up a lot of speed, hopefully moving roughly toward the global minimum, but its momentum will carry it right past the minimum. Then it will slow down and come back, accelerate again, overshoot again, and so on. It may oscillate this way many times before converging, so overall it will take much longer to converge than with a smaller momentum value.  
One way to produce a sparse model (i.e., with most weights equal to zero) is to train the model normally, then zero out tiny weights. For more sparsity, you can apply ℓ1 regularization during training, which pushes the optimizer toward sparsity. A third option is to use the TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit.  
Yes, dropout does slow down training, in general roughly by a factor of two. However, it has no impact on inference speed since it is only turned on during training. MC Dropout is exactly like dropout during training, but it is still active during inference, so each inference is slowed down slightly. More importantly, when using MC Dropout you generally want to run inference 10 times or more to get better predictions. This means that making predictions is slowed down by a factor of 10 or more.
