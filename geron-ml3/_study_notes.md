Review table of contents, end of book notes, prefaces.  
Review online nbs, linear algebra, auto-diff partial differential equations.  
Look over chp 1, 2 nb. 

Has good updated chapters on generative models, diffusion models, Pathways, GATO, Flamingo - brief discussions.  

Edits for fork does not count towards github commit squares.  

### Feb 15, 2023:  
Chp 1  
Interesting use of text in plots. Try looping through highlighted countries to assign different markers and colors to each country. Practice plotting.  
Regression, makes several lines. Try doing regression calculation by hand. Recall formula.  R squared and adjusted R squared.  

Do full notebook. Create a similar notebook using energy consumption per capita and GDP. Try life satisfactiin vs energy consumption. Is energy consumption a good proxy for GDP?  Corralation of energy consumption and GDP.  

Data is for 2015. Stored in github.com/ageron/data repo.  
Re-run. Get data for other periods. See if the slope has changed over time.  Will it be accurate to say there are 2 or 3 curves? Middle income countries and lower and upper income countries?  Or authoritatian and democracies?  

Answer all questions.  

Matplotlib code is interesting. Try memorizing these.
