# Chp2 data project, oil before and during Russia-Ukrain war.  

Chart supply out of Russia, compare to 5 years before, also 1991-2 fall of Soviet and bankruptcy.  
Compare US exports and production levels.  
Compare US Shale production levels.  

Other major producers, marginal producers like Iran, Venzuela, Nigeria.  
Storage capacity.  

ML satellite image analysis to look at ships leaving Russia, sanctions avoiding.  
Look for flairs, wasted oil.  
Monitor production in Russia using satellite images.  
Whi is buying? Storage levels change in China dn India.  
Industrial production in China and India, using night time luminosity.  

Shipping vessels information, domb through these data, transponder data, figure out which vessels are carrying Russian oil?  Sanctioned oil? Can be laundering going on after being sold to another country, but at what price?  
Russian oil has sulfer, so should be able to identify it, mixture require sweet crude.  


First to some time series analysis, seasonality, alpha channel to show historical bands, 5yr prior and 1991.  
Then more cool maps showing shipping vessels.  

Predict Russian productions quantity and price, July 2023-12/2024. 
Show band of historical production, forecast production.  
Use time series tabular data.  
Macro events correlations. 
Shorter term ARIMA to model seasonality.  
Lots of exploratory visual analysis.  
Also track shipping information, satellite images, flares, cars/truck activity.  

Predict US production and exports, where? Asia, S America, Europe.
