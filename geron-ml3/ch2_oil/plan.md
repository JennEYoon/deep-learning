# Chp2 data project, oil before and during Russia-Ukrain war.  

Chart supply out of Russia, compare to 5 years before, also 1991-2 fall of Soviet and bankruptcy.  
Compare US exports and production levels.  
Compare US Shale production levels.  

Other major producers, marginal producers like Iran, Venzuela, Nigeria.  
Storage capacity.  

ML satellite image analysis to look at ships leaving Russia, sanctions avoiding.  
Look for flairs, wasted oil.  
Monitor production in Russia using satellite images.  
Who is buying? Storage levels change in China & India.  
Industrial production in China and India, using night time luminosity, reported numbers, shipping container reports.    

Shipping vessels information, comb through these data, transponder data, figure out which vessels are carrying Russian oil?  Sanctioned oil? Can be laundering going on after being sold to another country, but at what price?  
Russian oil has sulfer, so should be able to identify it, mixture require sweet crude.  


First to some time series analysis, seasonality, alpha channel to show historical bands, 5yr prior and 1991.  
Then more cool maps showing shipping vessels.  

Predict Russian productions quantity, July 2023-2033, 10 years.  
  * How long does it take for existing pipelines and transport to break down without Western technical support and parts?  Assume sanctions will continue.
  * Break out permafrost, 1m bpd capacity at lower latitude, Eastern high sulfur crude.
  * Estimate amount of exports that are hiding from sanctions, non-traditional shippers, demand for products to mix with Russian crude for resale, exports from likely cheater countries vs domestic consumption.
  * Reports of technical investments in oil pipelines before the war, compare with Soviet period and 1991-2021 production and investment levels.  Confirm with oil majors' fiancial disclosures.
  * Spot check with satellite images from different months, shipping, ocean transports. Pipeline flow capacity estimates, wasted flare, gas.
  * Insurers reports on shipping from Russia.
  * How does it compare to 1991-1996, when production and exports declined for a time?

Predict rest of the world adjustments, responses:  
  * Marginal oil producers will increase production. Western countries may help some of these countries that were previously sanctioned?
  * Canada and US will build export facility for oil and LNG.
  * Lower water levels prevent large ships from using Suez Canal, may develop alternative paths?
  * Canada may develop new routed to Pacific from Alberta, they have money, demand will be there long-term. Less risky is using existing pipes to US and sell out of Cushing, Oklahoma and Gulf Coast.  Expanded export capacity in US Gulf already invested by Canadian firms.  Increase risk on oil spill, pipeline spill, LNG shipping spill.
  * China demand may stay low if post-covid manufacturing continues to shift out to SE Asia and India. But doesn't that mean demand from India and SE Asia for energy will increase instead?
  * Mexico plays an important part for refining and providing workers at lower price.  Cartels are a problem. US Military may need to get involved. If oil starts being more important than drugs, then possible. Mexico must want US Military to take out the cartels. Now it brings in too much money for Mexico to want cartels gone.
  * Venezuela and Columbia may produce some marginal crude.
  * Food production may shift to S America, need to pathways to sell feom Pacific Ocean side.  Argentina and Chile should work together to build a pathway from interior to the West, sell to SE Asia and India.   
    

Show band of historical production, forecast production.  
Use time series tabular data.  
Macro events correlations. 
Shorter term ARIMA to model seasonality.  
Lots of exploratory visual analysis.  
Also track shipping information, satellite images, flares, cars/truck activity.  

Predict US production and exports, where? Asia, S America, Europe.  

### First Item:  

  * Get oil and gas production numbers, Russia, IEA monthly report or raw data if available.
  * Superimpose on 1991-2021.  Predict how much Russia will continue to produce for the next 10 years.  Europe stops purchase in Dec2022-March2023. A small amount is exempt, but OK.
  * Look at consumption figures from the rest of the world as a check on Russian production.
  * Campare with production from US and Canada, oil and gas, same years, as a sanity check.
