### I. fast.ai 2020 class, fastai v2 package, Practical Deep Learning for Coders:  

***Moved current working folder to "fastai-app" repo. Older working folder still here to serve external links***  

  * Class part 1, March 2020: https://course.fast.ai/  
  * Book on Amazon:  https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=fastai&qid=1601497208&sr=8-1  
  * Full book in nbs:  https://github.com/fastai/fastbook  
  * Download fastai v2 package: https://github.com/fastai/fastai  

#### My revisit of fast.ai deep learning classes in August 2020:  
Back in 2018 when I first came across fast.ai, it was too hard for me to work through the notebooks because I didn't have the minimum required 1 year of focused coding experience in any language.  I came across Jeremy Howard's interviews on YouTube, and it peaked my interest again.  Now might be a good time to pick this up again.  There is also fastai book which is a new development.  It seems to be a condensed and coordinated version of the video lectures and a good reference. The book also covers part II, fundamentals of deep learning, and some of their basic machine learning class.  

June 12, 2021 Update:  
Part 2 youtube videos are still not available.  In the mean time, watching 2019 version of Part 2 is useful.  Fastai library explanation is helpful for understanding the v2 package, even thought the 2019 youtube videos refers to fastai v1 package instead.  Code walkthrough videos for fastai v2 package is also helpful.  Fastbook nb 19 (book chapter 19) had helpful information on understanding fastai package.  Chapter is still at a high level, so need to dive into actual code.  See github for fastai/fastai repo.

### II. My exercises from Chollet, Deep Learning with Python book  

  * Appendix: setup, tensorflow, keras, GPU on AWS EC2.   
    AWS EC2 GPU large instance still too expensive in May 2020, 70 cents/hour.    
    Use Google Colab free GPU instances instead. (My free $300 credit expired unused in April 2020.)  
  
  * Chp 4.5: Universal Workflow of Deep Learning  
  
  * Chp 5: Convolutional Networks -- has vision recognition examples.  
  
  * Chp 8 & 9: Generative Deep Learning, Conclusion  
    Has interesting examples, deep dream, art style transfer, face genereration.  Look forward to future research.  Limitations of deep learning.

###  V. Setup, Environment:  

  * I use conda env "dlpy" on Ubuntu (WSL), CPU x86 laptop:  
    Ubuntu-side "dlpy" env has python v 3.8, tensorflow v 2.2 installed using pip.  
  * PyTorch v 1.6 stable also installed to "dlpy" env on Ubuntu (WSL).
