### I. fast.ai 2020 class, fastai software v2, Practical Deep Learning for Coders:  

  * Class part 1, March 2020: https://course.fast.ai/  
  * Book on Amazon:  https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=fastai&qid=1601497208&sr=8-1  
  * Full notebooks in book:  https://github.com/fastai/fastbook  
  * Download software fastai v2: https://github.com/fastai/fastai  

#### My revisit of fast.ai deep learning classes in August 2020:  
Back in 2018 when I first came across fast.ai, it was too hard for me to work through the notebooks because I didn't have the minimum required 1 year of focused coding experience in any language.  I came across Jeremy Howard's interviews on YouTube, and it peaked my interest again.  Now might be a good time to pick this up again.  There is also fastai book which is a new development.  It seems to be a condensed and coordinated version of the video lectures and a good reference. The book also covers part II, fundamentals of deep learning, and some of their basic machine learning class.

### II. My exercises from Chollet, Deep Learning with Python book  

  * Appendix: setup, tensorflow, keras, GPU on AWS EC2.   
    AWS EC2 GPU large instance still too expensive in May 2020, 70 cents/hour.    
    Use Google Colab free GPU instances instead. (My free $300 credit expired unused in April 2020.)  
  
  * Chp 4.5: Universal Workflow of Deep Learning  
  
  * Chp 5: Convolutional Networks -- has vision recognition examples.  
  
  * Chp 8 & 9: Generative Deep Learning, Conclusion  
    Has interesting examples, deep dream, art style transfer, face genereration.  Look forward to future research.  Limitations of deep learning.

### III. Other:  

 * Goodfellow et al, Deep Learning book

###  V. Setup, Environment:  

  * I use conda env "dlpy" on Ubuntu (WSL), CPU x86 laptop:  
    Ubuntu-side "dlpy" env has python v 3.8, tensorflow v 2.2 installed using pip.  
  * PyTorch v 1.6 stable also installed to "dlpy" env on Ubuntu (WSL).
