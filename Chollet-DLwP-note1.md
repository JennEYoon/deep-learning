   (Also removed link to my Google Drive link.  Copyrighted.)
   * Get code samples

  * CIFAR 10 example, chapter 8, 10  
      Use Tensor Flow to load dataset cifar10  
      Can load tensor flow to windows 10 machine. Try 8/23/2019.  

  * 8/26/2019 -- got **tensorflow-datasets** installed   
      on Ubuntu with python 3.7 and conda3.  
      Need to use API to load cifar10.  Saw some examples.  

 * 10/17/2019 -- TensorFlow 2.0 out of Beta.  
      Install TF 2.0 on Ubuntu conda3 setup.
      Try out exercises from this book - December 2019. 
      
 *** AWS p2 GPU pricing       


#### May 10, 2020 notes  
  * Chapter 3)  
    - Use AWS p2.xlarge instance, AMI pre-formatted. $0.90 per hr as of 2017.  
      Can get expensive. Setup with tensorflow, keras and dependencies.  
      (***t2.micro*** instance is free tier.  NOT GPU, vCPU only.)   
      
    - Same price as of May 10, 2020, 90 cents/hr for ***p2.xlarge GPU w 4 cores***.  
    - Cheapest GPU is 52 cents/hr.  
      GPU/vCPU   ECU   Memory ... price per hour.

      AWS Free Tier includes 750 hours of Linux and Windows t2.micro instances each month for one year. To stay within the Free Tier, use only EC2 Micro instances.

#### Try Next: Use free Google GPU for deep learning.  
    Setup environment with tensorflow, kearas using Ubuntu machine.

### May 11-12, 2020 Setup environment: dlpy  

  * Finished setting up conda environment on Ubuntu side, "dlpy" 
  * tensorflow 2.2, keras, tensorboard included.  
  * jupyter notebook, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn, blas included.   
  * Some packages need pip, some need to specify channel conda-forge.  
  * Also per book, HDF5, Graphviz, opencv.  
  * Q) tensorflow-datasets?  nmist_fashion example on tensorflow doc site.  
    Done.  Installed May 22, 2020. mnist_fashion example doc tested.  
    Previous install of mnist numbers data Oct 2019 on Ubuntu conda3 base env.
