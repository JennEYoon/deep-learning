      - comment: I really liked this video on how to study hard by a med student.  Boy, those med students study really hard!  "There's no trying to be your best. No! You have to F'ing BE the BEST!!!"  Great advice on upping your game.

     * Concentrated 1.5-2 hours is much more effective than 30 minute increments. Software takes a long time to load all the context into memory.  Distractions takes away the context loading, and this needs to be done all over again.  Work in separate space with NO DISTRACTIONS.  Remove all bookmarks that will distract you.  Time management requires you to clear your calendar of all things except 1 or 2 items, at most.  What you take out is the most important secret to time management.  Redec closed Facebook account.  
     * When you feel somewhat comfortable with Fastai class notebooks, that is a good time to enter Kaggle competitions. Try to join on the start date so you will have the full 2 months to work on it.  Read other people's forum posts and uploaded Jupyter notebooks.  You will learn a TON from doing your own deep learning project.

      - comment: It's an excellent interview from a top student of Fastai's deep learning classes.

      - comment: A short but mostly complete guide to subject areas to study to become a data scientist. A good starting guide for beginners. Items I would add to this guide is studying deep learning and building an area of specialization where one can be an expert.  This one is less of a "how to study" and more of a "what to study" guide in data science.
