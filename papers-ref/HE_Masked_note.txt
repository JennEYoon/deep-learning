My notes, HE Masked Autoencoders paper.  

Images at end is from UN curated samples.  Read wrong as CURATED.  
Also validation on COCO vs trained on ImageNet 1K dataset, better.  
Metric is always image classification accuracy.  Not good for object semantic learning test.  
Best parts, shows a novel approach for images, architecture has room to grow, much faster with less compute resources, very deep training with no overfitting issue.
