  * YOLO notebook, repeat in 2 weeks, small group, Monday 9/7/2020 7pm.  
    Peter & Me, confusing when bounding boxes are formed, grid-center calculation used, max-wt for best fitting outline.  How is this done in single pass?
  * None of the new people showed up to small group, so don't need to repeat back-prop.  
  * Review back-prop on PyToch from scratch tutorial, and 3Blue1Brown video.  
  * Also pugged DSML Meetup on WCC Janelia Zoom today - 8/27/2020 TH.  
  	  
#### DLAI class 5: Sequence Models  
  * May 23, 2020 -- started watching videos.
