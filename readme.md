# My practice repo for deep-learning.  

Created: May 22, 2020  
Author: Jennifer E. Yoon

.bashrc alias: "adlpy" changes active conda env to "dlpy" and changes working directory to "/work/deep-learning".  Python v 3.8, tensorflow v 2, keras, tensorflow-datasets.  Coursera uses hdf5 data library - already installed.  Doctest and Pandocs already installed - use for my testing.  Later install unittest.  

Conda3 "base" env uses Python v 3.7. Has deep learning packages for Coursera DLAI class and Stanford CS231n class.  

First create project on local computer, git init and git commits.  Then create repo on Github, without any readme or license files. Copy SSH id.  On local machine, git remote add origin master, paste URL.  git push commits.  

## My exercises for Chollet, Deep Learning with Python book  

  * Appendix: setup, tensorflow, keras, GPU on AWS EC2. * Started watching class 5 sequence models.  
    AWS EC2 GPU large instance still too expensive, 70 cents/hour. Use Google CoLAB free GPU instances instead. 
  
  * Chp 9: Conclusions 
    Key Concepts Review, how to keep-up with new developments, future of deep learning, limitations of deep learning
  
  * Chp 4.5: Universal Workflow of Deep Learning  
  
  * Chp 5: Convolutional Networks -- has vision recognition examples.  
  

## Move Coursera.org Deep Learning.AI Specialization here permanently.  
  * June 8, 2020 start transfer of files from "learn-mldl" repo to "deep-learning" repo on Github.  
  * Later - to delete duplicate folder, also remove from "learn-mldl" repo duplicate.  

#### DLAI Class 3 - Structuring ML Projects  
  * June 9, 2020 - began rewatching videos, at 9/22 on Youtube playlist.  
  
#### Coursera DeepLearning.AI class 4 CNN moved here.  
  * As of June 1, 2020 Monday, current notebook versions have been copied here.    
  * Week 1 quiz #9 question on answers.  
  * Carefully do notebook step by step when I have more patience.  
  * Sub tensorflow intro notebook with version tf 2.2.  Class uses tf 1.2.  
  * Later weeks more interesting CNN class.  
  * To copy my quiz answers week 1.
