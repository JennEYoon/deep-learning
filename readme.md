### I. My exercises for Chollet, Deep Learning with Python book  

  * Appendix: setup, tensorflow, keras, GPU on AWS EC2.   
    AWS EC2 GPU large instance still too expensive in May 2020, 70 cents/hour.    
    Use Google CoLAB free GPU instances instead.  
  
  * Chp 9: Conclusions 
    Key Concepts Review, how to keep-up with new developments, future of deep learning, limitations of deep learning
  
  * Chp 4.5: Universal Workflow of Deep Learning  
  
  * Chp 5: Convolutional Networks -- has vision recognition examples.

### II. Coursera.org Deep Learning.AI Specialization - moved here from "learn-mldl" repo.   
  
#### Class Links: Coursera, Deep Learning AI Specialization:       
      https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?  
      
 * Class 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning   
 
 * Class 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks  
 
 * Class 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects  
 
 * Class 4: Convolutional Neural Networks   
   
 * Class 5: Sequence Models    


###  III. Other classes, Udemy mostly.  

  * Complete Tensorflow 2 - Udemy, Jose Portilla  
    - I signed  up 8/6/2020     

### Setup, Environment:  

  * Use conda env "dlpy" on Ubuntu, CPU x86 laptop:  
    Ubuntu-side "dlpy" env has python v 3.8, tensorflow v 2.2 installed using pip.  
  * PyTorch v 1.6 stable installed in July 2020, to "dlpy" conda virtual environment.
