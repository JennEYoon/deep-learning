# My practice repo for deep-learning.  

Created: May 22, 2020  
Author: Jennifer E. Yoon  

git history cleanup, remove deleted folders/large files from git history on 6/25/2022
 * successfully reduced repo size from 1.3 GB to 500 mb.  
 * removed empty commits related to deleted files. Commit number for repo declined.  
 * unexpectedly increased total number of commits on github graph by 900 in 2020 and 600 in 2021.

### I. NVIDIA deep learning book  

  * Magnus Ekman, Learning Deep Learning, NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, c 2022 NVIDIA Corp., Addison-Wesley publishing

Has extremely good explanations of math and concepts with colored charts. Cheatsheet at the end of the book organizes the different DL models and how to use them. It's not a beginner book. Intermediate to advanced book, in my opinion.  Better than Chollet book 2nd ed.  Has more complete details.  Subtitle is Theory and Practice of Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Transformers using TensorFlow.  This is a good description of the subject matter.  I don't know what transformers are in deep learning, so that will be interesting.  Appendix has PyTorch vs TensorFlow chart for how to convert your project code between these two libraries.   


### II. My exercises from Chollet, Deep Learning with Python, 2nd ed, c 2021       

 * Manning book:  https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition  
 * Github repo:  https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks  

### III. Practical Deep Learning for Coders, fastai 

***Moved to "fastai-deep-learning" repo in Oct 2021***  
 to add, new link

### IV.  Coursera Deep Learning Specialization classes  

***Move to "Coursera-DLAI" repo in Oct 2020***  
 to add link

###  V. Setup, Environment:  

  * New setup, RTX 3070 GPU laptop, June 2022:  
    Windows 10 with WSL2 Ubuntu 20.4   
    env base - Tensorflow v6, Cuda toolkit, Cuda gpu drivers, python v 3.8.  
    env dl - Pytorch, fastai v2, Python v3.7
    VS Code with Python v3.10 extension on Windows   
    minconda3 on WSL2 Ubuntu.  

  * I use conda env "dlpy" on Ubuntu (WSL), CPU x86 laptop:  
    Ubuntu-side "dlpy" env has python v 3.8, tensorflow v 2.2 installed using pip.  
  * PyTorch v 1.6 stable also installed to "dlpy" env on Ubuntu (WSL).
