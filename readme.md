### I. fast.ai 2020 version, Practical Deep Learning for Coders:  

  * fast.ai deep learning classes revisit, August 2020.  
    Back in 2018 when I first came across fast.ai, it was too hard for me to work through the notebooks because I didn't have the minimum required 1 year of focused coding experience in any language.  I came across Jeremy Howard's interviews on YouTube, and it peaked my interest again.  Now might be a good time to pick this up again.  There is also fastai in a book form, which is a new development.  It seems to be a condensed and coordinated version of the video lectures and a good reference.  Andrew Ng's DeepLearning.AI series on Coursera.org is also helping me.  I can understand fast.ai notebooks much better, after doing Coursera's deep learning classes.

### II. My exercises for Chollet, Deep Learning with Python book  

  * Appendix: setup, tensorflow, keras, GPU on AWS EC2.   
    AWS EC2 GPU large instance still too expensive in May 2020, 70 cents/hour.    
    Use Google Colab free GPU instances instead. (My free $300 credit expired unused in April 2020.)  
  
  * Chp 9: Conclusions 
    Key Concepts Review, how to keep-up with new developments, future of deep learning, limitations of deep learning
  
  * Chp 4.5: Universal Workflow of Deep Learning  
  
  * Chp 5: Convolutional Networks -- has vision recognition examples.

### III. Coursera, Deep Learning AI Specialization:       
      https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?  
      
***Update 9/30/2020: Coursera.org put all notebooks and quizzes behind a paywall.  No part of them are viewable without paying.***  
***We'll probably stop using this class for our local Meetup sessions going forward.***
      
 * Class 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning   
 
 * Class 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks  
 
 * Class 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects  
 
 * Class 4: Convolutional Neural Networks   
   
 * Class 5: Sequence Models

### IV. PyTorch Tutorials and Classes:  

  * Udemy - PyTorch Complete class - Jose Portilla (Signed up August 2020)   
  
  * PyTorch - Tutorial from SciPy 2020  
 
---  

###  IV. Setup, Environment:  

  * I use conda env "dlpy" on Ubuntu (WSL), CPU x86 laptop:  
    Ubuntu-side "dlpy" env has python v 3.8, tensorflow v 2.2 installed using pip.  
  * PyTorch v 1.6 stable installed in July 2020, to "dlpy" conda virtual environment on Ubuntu (WSL).
