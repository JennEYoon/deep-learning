Book Source links: 
 * Github notebooks:  https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2  
 * nbviewer version of Jupyter notebooks:  https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/index.ipynb  

 * Amazon kindle book link:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XGF2G87?pf_rd_p=183f5289-9dc0-416f-942e-e8f213ef368b&pf_rd_r=5KAD64A6GQ5ADBP7A78R  
 * O'Reilly doesn't have a link to buy the book, only for Safari subscription access.  

O'Reilly seems to have stopped selling books directly to readers.  Seems like a good choice since the quality of their print books has gone done in the last five years.  I had complained to them for the blurry and faint text from their books.  Now they are a conference and online education organizer and tech books publisher.  This is more in line with their core competency.  

#### My Notes, Date November 11, 2019.  

Put my own reproduced work here.  Maybe extend some notebook.
Later, post some of the notebook on my project page at datasciY.com. 

Cloned repo is in my "c:/python/work/w_handsonML2" folder.  
2019 June first published.

Has a lot of confirmed errata, so the book seems to have gone to press without correcting many of the mistakes.  Maybe don't buy the physical book anymore.  Have ebook early release version.  This may be sufficient, since even the published version has many errata.  

 * #2 notebook - full-cycle - housing prices, too generic dataset, but includes deep learning.  Look into it, and do a better project.  Only use certain houses to see if I can get an advantage in housing price prediction.  

 * Update 11/18/2019 - Moved book to wip2-classes folder.  

#### 8/22/2020 bought Kindle version, $33 with $4 coupon savings.  
  * 6th printing 8/15/2020 - corrected many errata, corrected math formatting problems in Kindle version.  
  * Has pretty good DL Part 2.  
  * Part 1 is good for reviewing basics with Python instead of R.
