# My notes & practice - Hands-on Machine Learning, 2nd edition book (8/14/2020, 6th release, Kindle version).  

Purchased Kindle version, 6th release 8/14/2020.  Fixed lots of errata, typos, math formula formatting on screen-version.  

Book Source links: 
 * Github notebooks:  https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2  
 * nbviewer version of Jupyter notebooks:  https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/index.ipynb  
   \-\-\-   
 * Amazon kindle book, printed book.  
 * O'Reilly doesn't have a link to buy the book, only for Safari subscription access.  

O'Reilly seems to have stopped selling books directly to readers.  Seems like a good choice since the quality of their print books has gone done in the last five years.  I had complained to them for the blurry and faint text from their books.  Now they are a conference and online education organizer and tech books publisher.  This is more in line with their core competency.  


#### 8/22/2020 bought Kindle version, $33 with $4 coupon savings.  

  * Has pretty good DL Part 2.  
  * Part 1 is good for reviewing ML basics with Python instead of R.  
  * Downloaded git clone to C:/python/repos/deep-learning/ without .git folder.
