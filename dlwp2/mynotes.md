# Study notes for Deep Learning with Python, 2nd edition, 2021 c.  

#### 9/29/2021 Meetup Small Group:  

 * Decided to study this book next.  Chp 1 & 2 for October 25, 2021 Monday 7pm.  
 * Chp 1 - overview
   - charts not update from 2017.  To message author about this.  
   - Most Used Library - updated to 2020 Kaggle DS User Survey. Other chart still not updated from 2017. 

   - A different 2020 Kaggle <u>winners'</u> survey was 70% PyTorch and 30% Tensorflow for deep learning projects.  

   - Scikit-Learn was number 1, library in Kaggle users' survey, by a large margin. This is not for deep learning.

   - https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/2021-kaggle-data-science-machine-learning-survey  
      - It's user's survey, NOT deep learning winner's main libraries used.  
      - Can dive into it, enter Kaggle Challenge for a prize?? 
      - More than 50% of respondents are students, and more than 70%? or respondents are foreigners.  
      - Not very good to go by this survey, some 14% of respondents have never coded or used a ML model!  
      - At least filter out all irrelevant respondents. Use only those with 1+ years of coding and ML experience, and from US and Canada.  India we know if very different market from US, with far more students and much younger in age.

   - Compare with 1st ed? 
   - 10/29/2021 TH - finished reading 5am 
   - 10/29/2021 TH 1.5h read Kaggle 2021 DS/ML User Survey, make notes. 


 * Chp 2 - more detailed math for NN, CNN, MNIST example than Fastai book.  
   - compare with fastai book presentations in chp 17 NN and chp 13 CNN.  
   - mostly finished reading 10/29/2021 TH 5 am, to reveiw details 1-layer chart and code, p 72-82.  
   - not as detailed as fastai chp17, to do this anyway, to reproduce everything with Numpy.  
 * v7 MEAP as of today, Nov 2021 est publication date.
