# My Notes, Deep Learning with Python, 2nd ed, c2021 Nov.  

#### Meetup DSML small group, Sept 2021:  
Picked book with Elaheh, but she never came back afterwards.  
Should not have included her in the decision for next book for the meetup.  
But Peter and Dan were not happy with Fastai book and wanted a different one.  
They seem happy with it.  
I would have preferred NVIDIA book, but that's too advanced for general Meetup people.  

#### Meetup DSML small group, 11/1/2021:
Date changed to Nov 1, 2021, Monday 7pm.  
Peter's "dei" link.  

 * First 2 chapters of book.  
 * Chp 1 overview of deep learning -- seems unchanged from 1st ed. Can skim quickly.   
 * Chp 2 math, nn, cnn, mnist.  Color graphs.  
   Similar to other books, Fastai chp 17, 13, 4.  

#### Meetup DSML small group, 12/6/2021:
