# Tasks, deep-leaning repo.  

#### Jan 26, 2022 Wed:  
move udemy bootcamp here - no.  

Chollet book, chp 10 notes  
WSL2 - check tensorflow cpu version install  
Try running chp 4 again, why time out?  Do I need to specify tf cpu before running?  

#### April 7, 2022 Th:  
Need to squash git history for this repo, deep-learning. 1.22 GB now.  
Wait till Dec 2022. Hopefully history will not matter so much by then.  
Squash to delete files moved out of repo to make room.  
That might reduce it by several hundred megabyte, to get repo back down to under 1 GB.
