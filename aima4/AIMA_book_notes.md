Read these first.  

Chp 1 history - very broad.  
chp 2 - Intelligent Agents
chp 3 - Searching, Simple

Interesting. 

### March 3, 2022 Thursday:  
Covered all of chp 2 and 3.  
Julius and Elsa presented.

### April 7, 2022 Thursday:  
chp 4 and 5
4) Complex Search
5) Adversarial Search and Games
Chp 5 not economic games, but chess, Go etc.  
Uses A-B search, reinforcement learning, simulated game play, Monte Carlo tree search.  

 * Me to present 4.5 online search. Not internet but stading online, in real time. 
 * Went well, but coudn't focus on other people's presentations when I'm presenting.  Can't understand much of the paper when I didn't read it either, even when I am not presenting. So maybe that's not the issue.  Papers are hard to inderstand, even when I did read it.  Book can be understood when I read it.  1st year standard textbook for computer science major.  Fill in holes for people coming from other backgrounds.  Good for my case.
