### TOC US version:  
<kdb><img src="AIMA.US.png" style="width:650px; border:6px solid black;" /></kdb>
Doesn't work - Github does not render image style, not possible to add a border to the image.  

### TOC Global version:  
A few chapters out of order.  1 new chapter.  
Was printed several months after US version.  
I have this version
