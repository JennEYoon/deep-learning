### fast,ai, Jeremy Howard:   

* fast.ai deep learning classes revisit.  https://github.com/fastai/fastbook  
  
    Back in 2018 when I first came across fast.ai, it was too hard for me to work through the notebooks because I didn't have the minimum required 1 year of focused coding experience in any language.  I came across Jeremy Howard's interview again on YouTube, and it peaked my interest again.  Now [8/2020] might be a good time to pick this up again.  There is also a book form.  It seems to be a good condensed and coordinated version of the video lectures.  Andrew Ng's DeepLearning.AI series on Coursera.org is also helping.  I can understand fast.ai notebooks much better, after doing Coursera's deep learning series.

 * Concentrated 1.5-2 hours is much more effective than 30 minute increments. Software takes a long time to load all the context into memory.  Distractions takes away the context loading, and this needs to be done all over again.  Work in separate space with NO DISTRACTIONS.  Remove all bookmarks that will distract you.  Time management requires you to clear your calendar of all things except 1 or 2 items, at most.  What you take out is the most important secret to time management.  Redec closed Facebook.  Me, I never got involved with it.  For me - watching political news has been the time waster, ever since Trump was running for office in June 2015.  Some of this is necessary to be an informed voter and citizen, but it's gone far, way over, the mark where the time wasted turns distructive.  
 
  * Created a carefully curated list of podcasts and youtubes I will watch per week, and stick to those schedule.  Don't keep watching like a zombie.  Same for audiobooks.  Create a budget for fun or relaxing books, and follow those time budgets.  For non-fiction, I can allow more time.  Usually don't have a problem of wasting time with non-fiction books.  
  
  * Kaggle:  
    - Once you start to feel comfortable with fast.ai notebooks and want to try something new or a new challenge, that is a good time to enter a Kaggle Challenge.  
    - Try to enter from the first day, so you will be able to work on it over 2 months.  You will underestimate how much progress you can make over that time, while reading others' forums on what works.  
    - Kaggle is closest to the actual work or project, so it is a very good approximation of your first job.  
    - Secret Sauce to Kaggle is Cross-Validation and Ensembling [models].  
    - If you don't have time to work on it on some days, you can think about the problem on a bus ride to work for some minutes.  
    - Primarily, you will learn a TON while working on the project.  
    
  * Fun and enjoyment is the most important thing, while learning machine learning.  You need fun to keep doing it for the long-run, and you become good by doing it for 2 years, 3 years, or 4 years.  I've been learning ML for 2 years now, so I am on my way.  It took 1 year of solid learning before Python syntax stopped just sliding across my fielf of vision without me registering them in my mind.  The brackets, colon, dot, parenthesis, and spaces, will just go into one ear and go straight out the other year.  I had a devil of a time trying to remember what those symbols were doing in the code.
