CAT, Concatenate command:  
  * View file:  cat file1.txt 
  * View multiple files:  cat file1.txt file2.txt  
  * View all text files in folder:  cat *.txt  
  * View long file with more (pipe):  cat file1.txt | more
  * View with line numbers:  cat -n file3.txt 
  * View with supressed multiple empty lines:   cat -s newfile.txt 
  * View content in reverse order:  tac file1.txt    
  No quotations around file name.  All works.  
  --- 
  * Create a new file:   cat > newfile.txt  
    (empty line to type text, Control-C to exit)  
  * Copy contents of file1 to newfile:  cat file1.txt > newfile.txt  
  * Merge files:   cat "file1.txt" "file2.txt" "file3.txt" > "mergedfile.txt"  
  * Append file (double arrow):   cat "file2.txt" >> "file1.txt"  
    - Quotes for file names seem only for merge and append operations. Why?
