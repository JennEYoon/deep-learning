Asus ROG Strix G17 is faster, by 2X, than Google Colab GPU free processor!  

Chollet chp12 p1 text generation notebook.  
ROG G17: Took 5 hours with 200 epochs, 90 sec/epoch, then down to 84 sec towards end.  
Colab GPU: only run 40 epochs. 164 sec/epoch. 
Also Colab simply will not run, download data, during the day.  Congestion.  
So could not have run this on Colab at all, if only daytime hours were available. 
Running timing test at night 11:40 pm EST, 6/23/2022.  

Really glad I bought a GPU laptop. RTX 3070 is only a few percent slower than 3080 or 3080 Super, 
due to temperature and power issues.  But is much faster than RTX 3060.  Sweet spot.  

96% or RAM 15 GB used during training.  Could possibly increase it to 32GB.  
May or may not help with training speed. Colab has plenty of RAM but is slower to train.  
Colab usign 40-60% of GPU Ram 12GB/16GB 
Colab 2 GB/12GB system Ram using  
Colab 40 GB/78GB storage disc using

> As of October 13, 2018, Google Colab provides a single 12GB NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU that can be used up to 12 hours continuously. Recently, Colab also started offering free TPU.
