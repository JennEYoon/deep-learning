# Notes from chp 10, time series, Chollet 2nd ed.  

First part about handling time-series data, periodicity.  

Related to Pandas time-series functions.   

Last example uses deep-learning model, not sure what it's doing yet.

RNN - Periodic repeats.  Seasonaility.  Predict future temperature.  
Regression model is straight statistics. 
Read more about recurrent neTWorks architecture.  How is periodic repeats handles in neural networks?  

Small group pushed off to next Monday Feb 28, 2022.  Peter look for anomaly detection models in time-series.  
Watch videos on RNN from other sources.  Sentdex good one.  From scratch  

Jena data, temperature every 10 minutes, from roof MaxPlank.  
Peter - anomaly detection, saw in GTC conference.

 * Context  
Jena Climate is weather timeseries dataset recorded at the Weather Station of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany.  

 * Content  
Jena Climate dataset is made up of 14 different quantities (such air temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind direction, and so on) were recorded every 10 minutes, over several years. This dataset covers data from January 1st 2009 to December 31st 2016.  

Index	Features	Format	Description
1	Date Time	01.01.2009 00:10:00	Date-time reference
2	p (mbar)	996.52	The pascal SI derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure. Meteorological reports typically state atmospheric pressure in millibars.
3	T (degC)	-8.02	Temperature in Celsius
4	Tpot (K)	265.4	Temperature in Kelvin
5	Tdew (degC)	-8.9	Temperature in Celsius relative to humidity. Dew Point is a measure of the absolute amount of water in the air, the DP is the temperature at which the air cannot hold all the moisture in it and water condenses.
6	rh (%)	93.3	Relative Humidity is a measure of how saturated the air is with water vapor, the %RH determines the amount of water contained within collection objects.
7	VPmax (mbar)	3.33	Saturation vapor pressure
8	VPact (mbar)	3.11	Vapor pressure
9	VPdef (mbar)	0.22	Vapor pressure deficit
10	sh (g/kg)	1.94	Specific humidity
11	H2OC (mmol/mol)	3.12	Water vapor concentration
12	rho (g/m ** 3)	1307.75	Airtight
13	wv (m/s)	1.03	Wind speed
14	max. wv (m/s)	1.75	Maximum wind speed
15	wd (deg)	152.3	Wind direction in degrees
