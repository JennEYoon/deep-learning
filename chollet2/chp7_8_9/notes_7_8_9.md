Chapter 7, 8 notes.  

### Keras dive chp 7  

Some basics covered in chp 4. Not explained there. Sequential model, fit().
Other types of architecture here. Explanations some.  

 * To run code later.  

### CNN vision chp 8  

Straight up CNN transfer learning.  
Fit 1 cycle  
Just like Fastai class.  

### Chp 9 goes into visualization of middle layers, callbacks, tensor board.  
Different architectures then Sequential. Customizing a training loop.  
Has 3 parts. Do only one chapter next.  
 * Part 3 all channels visualiztion, cat exampe, to study more. Best part. 
 * Chp 14 Conclusion nb has summary code for models CNN, RNN, Transformer.
