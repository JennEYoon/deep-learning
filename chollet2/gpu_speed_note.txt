Asus ROG Strix G17 is faster, by 2X, than Google Colab GPU free processor!  

Chollet chp12 p1 text generation notebook.  
ROG G17: Took 5 hours with 200 epochs, 90 sec/epoch, then down to 84 sec towards end.  
Colab GPU: only run 40 epochs. 164 sec/epoch. 
Also Colab simply will not run, download data, during the day.  Congestion.  
So could not have run this on Colab at all, if only daytime hours were available. 
Running timing test at night 11:40 pm EST, 6/23/2022.  

Really glad I bought a GPU laptop. RTX 3070 is only a few percent slower than 3080 or 3080 Super, 
due to temperature and power issues.  But is much faster than RTX 3060.  Sweet spot.  

96% or RAM 15 GB used during training.  Could possibly increase it to 32GB.  
May or may not help with training speed. Colab has plenty of RAM but is slower to train.
