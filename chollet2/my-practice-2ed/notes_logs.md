#### Meetup DSML main group, Dec will be last online! Yeah!!!  
really tired with constant churn.  

#### Dec 14, 2021, last DSML Meetup ended with a Bang!  Yeah!!!   
My talk and open discussions went well.  Dan's talk also went well.  
Deborah came late to the event and wants to continue the Meetup Online.  
Well its up to her now to do the work to continue next year.  
I won't be spending any more effort or time on it, until the group meets in person again.  

#### Dec 15:  
Took 3h today for communications. 4h prep yesterday.  1 full day of work!!!  
Coordinating activities takes a lot of time, looking up info.  
I'm not going to add emails to Slack.  If new lead didn't do it, I'm not going to worry about that.  
Already spent far too much time drafting a long email, without ever getting a reply from her before.
