numpy axis=0, collapse in vertical direction, column sum.  
axis=1, collapse in horizontal direction, row sum.  

To run exercises - some done.   
WSL2 installed.  Took a long time, 5h so far.  
installing conda env and pkgs. 
next day, 4h more, setting up env, testing, for wsl1 and wsl2.  

github SSH key only in wsl1.  Figure out how to add to wsl2.  
vs code runs from wsl2, can select which conda env on wsl2 miniconda3.  
Colab - rename file and save back to Github after editing.
